 malta.1.d:0 "A storm is about to hit Europe. Fightings between all those greedy powers will take place all over the world, but more importantly in Europe and Africa. And who's in the middle of both of these continents? Malta.\n\nSituated at the heart of the Mediterranean sea, we should not be considered a minor power. Malta could play a very important role in the upcoming storm and even shift the balance in its favor. Will Malta succeed or fail miserably? Either way, it's time to wake up and show the world what our island is capable of."
 malta.1.a:0 "Our Time is Coming!"
 malta.2.t:0 "The Heart of the Mediterranean Sea"
 malta.2.d:0 "Our current location benefits us in many ways. We are directly situated between two big continents, surrounded by the waves but also trade routes. We are also a very important British naval base. But should we really limit our island to just being a \"strategic location\"? We have to study our surroundings a bit more and establish a strategy."
 malta.2.a:0 "Truly the Heart of the Mediterranean."
 malta.3.t:0 "Speech for the Workers"
 malta.3.d:0 "Our workers are demotivated, there is so little to do on the island that they'd rather eat air and sleep on the grass than earn money. Someone once said that propaganda was a good method of encouragement, but way too brutal. [ROOT.GetLeader] decided to hold a simple speech and promised for changes \"very soon\". Although that made everyone happy and motivated, he has no idea of what could be done to improve their condition, and simply hopes everyone will forget about his speech."
 malta.3.a:0 "Motivate them to work harder in the factories."
 malta.3.b:0 "Make a speech to glorify the workers!"
 malta.4.t:0 "The Maltese Strategy"
 malta.4.d:0 "Today was an important day for Malta. After a few meetings, a strategy was proposed to definitely change the destiny of the country. A Tower. It could go as high as we want and be protected from enemy assaults. Many are skeptical about such an ambitious project, but for once, all political parties present in the meeting agreed on one thing : it could lead Malta to its deserved greatness. To make the cut and finally make a choice, a random person in the street was taken to the meeting and asked what they thought of the Tower. The answer was \"It looks aight, can I go?\". This is it. The \"Tower\" project has begun. The next step is finding three suitable locations to build the pillars of the Tower on, the fourth one being the heart of Valetta itself."
 malta.4.a:0 "Our strategy is infallible."
 malta.5.t:0 "Study of the St Elmo Bridge"
 malta.5.d:0 "The St Elmo Bridge is a single-span arched truss steel footbridge leading from the foreshore of Fort Saint Elmo in Valletta to the breakwater at the entrance of the Grand Harbour.\n\nIt was stated as stable and a very good location to hold one of the Tower's pillars. With everyone agreeing, it was time to move on forward to the other pillars' location."
 malta.5.a:0 "The St Elmo Bridge is the key to our success!"
 malta.6.t:0 "The Study of the Azure Window"
 malta.6.d:0 "The Azure Window, also known as the Dwejra Window, is a 28-metre-tall (92 ft) natural arch on the island of Gozo, located just off the shores of Malta.\n\nThe location is perfect for building one of the pillars, and our best engineers assured that \"The Azure Window is here to stay for at least 10 000 years, it won't fall!\". They are engineers, we have to trust them, right?"
 malta.6.a:0 "Our knowledge grows stronger."
 malta.7.t:0 "The Study of the Dingli Cliffs"
 malta.7.d:0 "Dingli is a village in the Northern Region of Malta. Its cliffs are deemed to be unbreakable and to offer very good protection against foreign invaders. Throughout the rule of the Order of Saint John, Dingli was considered to be safe from corsair attacks because it was impossible for pirates to land in the area due to the Dingli Cliffs.\n\nIt didn't need much more than that to be chosen as one of the pillars' location. After all, it needs to be stable but also safe."
 malta.7.a:0 "The Dingli Cliffs are unbreakable."
 malta.8.t:0 "Adoption of a New Strategy"
 malta.8.d:0 "Although the current strategy of the Tower is still in progress, it needs a few modifications and additions in order to work. Firstly, each floor should be able to host a considerable amount of population. It should also have space for a factory of any kind. Lastly, it should also be protected from aerial attacks with hidden anti-air guns.\n\nThe Tower should also, somehow, find a way to sustain itself, in resources and money. The government assured that they could pay for the Tower, but it is believed to be a lie that won't last past a few floors. All of those requirements have to be kept in mind in order to build the Tower."
 malta.8.a:0 "We can do it."
 malta.9.t:0 "Birth of the Tower"
 malta.9.d:0 "The construction of the Tower has officially begun! With the first floor seeing workers from all over Malta coming to work on it, everyone is having big expectations but is also fearing the worst. As promised, the government covered the fees for the construction, but it was later revealed that they had to take a loan to afford it. Showing signs of weakness now would be a fatal blow to the Tower though, everyone must stick to the plan."

In fact, the Tower is accumulating so many debts that the economy is crumbling. After an urgent meeting about why having no money sucks, it was decided that new ways had to be found to earn money and grow the Tower while paying off debts. Only one rule was given : Find a solution, by any means.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] admitted that during his vacations, he heard about pirate stories which gave him ideas. But he is from the government... He cannot be linked to any illegal activities, right? ...And this is how everyone agreed on three solutions that could be elaborated with the help of the army and the navy : Coastal Raids, Fishing, and Privateering."

What do we do if the water is not technically ours? We claim it as ours! ...And this is how Malta angered many countries at once. But let's think positive, the Tower is saved!

 malta.17.d:0 "In a recent study, it was shown that an average Maltese student in high school would spend 25% of their day at school, and 50% in the elevators from home to school. It was first proposed to add vending machines in the elevators, but those would take up too much space and during a recent test, one man was put in an elevator from the first floor to the Headquarters. When he arrived, the vending machine had already been emptied and the guy was starving, hitting the machine and begging for more.\n\nAfter that failed experience, one man came with such a simple, yet genius idea : music! Since then, all elevators in the Tower have been equipped with speakers diffusing Maltese music all day and night. \"A brilliant solution\", justified [ROOT.GetLeader]."
 malta.17.a:0 "Why did suicide rate in the tower increase by 20%?"
 malta.18.t:0 "Jetpack Licences"
 malta.18.d:0 "Investing in elevator music turned out to be the worst thing ever imagined on this island. The man who brought up this idea was fired and [ROOT.GetLeader] stated that he never supported this idea in the first place. But the worst had already been done... Speakers were installed with alien technology, thus impossible to remove.\n\nNow, a radical solution had to be found. And... The mysterious guy selling futuristic tanks just happened to have THE solution. Jetpacks! After few validated tests, it was decided to reserve elevators for prisoners and \"people that are way too happy in general\". Much of the car production in the Tower was also directly converted to the production of Jetpacks. They are cheaper, easy to learn, and allow to travel fast between floors. It was also decided that those would be used during missions, acting as air support. Although accidents have increased by 500% since then, [ROOT.GetLeader] congratulated everyone and especially the \"Bitcoin Guy\"."

 malta.19.t:0 "The Doomed Tower?"

Scared of the worst, the government quickly called a meeting with all engineers and scientists of the Tower being called. The mysterious guy from Uruguay was also present and was designed fired, to which he simply answered \"But I make cool arts\"... They decided to not fire him and instead ask for his opinion.\n\nAfter long hours, an official report came... The Tower is safe! In fact, it will now never move ever again, and although it might make investors scared, one simply proposed to up the funds we'd give them for each floor, which totally convinced them. Money can make everything work, really."

#Leaders
 POLITICS_GERALD_STRICKLAND_DESC:0 "Gerald Paul Joseph Cajetan Carmel Antony Martin Strickland, 6th Count della Catena, 1st Baron Strickland was born in Valletta, the son of naval officer Commander Walter Strickland, from the ancient English Strickland family of Sizergh, and Maria Aloysia Bonici-Mompalao, the niece and heiress of Sir Nicholas Sceberras Bologna, fifth Count della Catena in Malta, whom Gerald succeeded in 1875. He is now a Maltese and British politician and peer, who serves as Prime Minister of Malta, in addition to sitting successively in the House of Commons and House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_BORG_OLIVIER_DESC:0 "George Borg Olivier was born in Valletta, the son of Olivier Borg Olivier de Puget Paleologo and Rosa. Borg Olivier grew up in a family steeped in Nationalist politics. His uncle Salvatore was speaker of the house and then a senator, and led the opposition to Lord Strickland's Constitutional Party in the 1920s before becoming a cabinet minister during the premiership of Ugo P. Mifsud in the early 1930s. He now is a Maltese statesman and leading politician. He is the leader of the Nationalist Party and is also known for his opposition to the democratic rules over the island."
 POLITICS_PAUL_BOFFA_DESC:0 "Born in Vittoriosa on 30 June 1890, Paul Boffa was educated at the Lyceum and at the University of Malta from where he graduated as a medical doctor in 1912. During World War I, he served with the Royal Medical Corps in Malta, Salonika and on hospital ships. After the war, he set up in private practice in Paola. Sir Paul Boffa is now leader of the Labour Party and prime minister of Malta."
 POLITICS_JORGI_PRECA_DESC:0 "George Preca was born in Valletta on 12 February 1880 as the seventh of nine children of Vincent and Nathalie Ceravolo Preca. His father was both a merchant and a health inspector. He received his baptism on 17 February 1880 in the Church of Our Lady of Porto Salvo. He is a Maltese Catholic priest and the founder of the Society of Christian Doctrine as well as a Third Order Carmelite. He is known as "Dun Ġorġ" in Maltese and Pope John Paul II dubbed him \"Malta’s second father in faith\". He is now the leader of the Independents Party of Malta."
 POLITICS_THE_TOWER_DESC:0 "The Tower is the savior and protector of Malta. All Maltese people only wish to see it grow more and more, and they will make sure to defend it with their lives. With such dedication, it could only be clear who the true leader of Malta had to be. The Tower conquered all the foes of the island and dominated the Mediterranean sea, perhaps even the world. Many fear it and many admire it. But whatever people think, the great thing about a tower is that it does not need a statue of itself to feel great."
